## Description

###General: 
track development time
use git to split your code into commits
provide a link to the live version of the site and access to the WP Dashboard


###Markup:
the layout should be fully responsive and pixelperfect (at the same resolution as the design)
use SASS/SCSS and Gulp/Webpack for building assets
using the BEM methodology will be a plus
any popular framework/library can be used (Foundation, Bootstrap, etc)
cross-browser compatibility: Chrome, Firefox and Safari (latest versions, can be checked via BrowserStack Trial)
semantic: you must use HTML5 elements (“section”, “aside”, etc)
must be provided accessibility (keyboard navigation through elements, form fields, etc)


###JS:
use ES6 syntax in JS files
use AJAX for sorting items on the main page ("Join The Team" section)
implement filters by technology, department, location and search query
using one of the JS frameworks (React/Angular/Vue/Svelte) will be a bonus


###Wordpress:
all content must be editable from the WP Dashboard
use CPT UI and ACF plugins
write a class with static methods for your custom functions


###Don't implement:
switching languages functionality (header) 
success stories quote (single vacancy page)
